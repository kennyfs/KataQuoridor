//Old model versions, no longer supported:
//0 = V1 features, with old head architecture using crelus (no longer supported)
//1 = V1 features, with new head architecture, no crelus
//2 = V2 features, no internal architecture change.

//Supported model versions:
//3 = V3 features, many architecture changes for new selfplay loop, including multiple board sizes
//4 = V3 features, scorebelief head
//5 = V4 features, changed current territory feature to just indicate pass-alive
//6 = V5 features, disable fancy features
//7 = V6 features, support new rules configurations
//8 = V7 features, unbalanced training, button go, lead and variance time
//9 = V7 features, shortterm value error
//10 = V7 features, shortterm value error done more properly
//11 = V7 features, supports mish activations by desc actually reading the activations
//12 = V7 features, optimisic policy head
//13 = V7 features, Adjusted scaling on shortterm score variance, and made C++ side read in scalings.
//14 = V7 features, Squared softplus for error variance predictions
//15 = V7 features, Extra nonlinearity for pass output
//16 = V7 features, Q value predictions in the policy head
//17 = V7 features, dropped Q value predictions, introduced transformers and added guards to unused params
